## Overview
    This project reiterates the beloved classic game Mortal Kombat in Python.
There is a twist though! The fighters are none other than some of our favorite
Scooby Doo characters: Shaggy and the Headless Horseman. The game consists of
two rounds or unlimited rounds if you're feeling saucy :weary:
    We hope you will have a great time playing it! Take a moment of
appreciation for the soundtrack :relieved:
